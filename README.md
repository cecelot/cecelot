### Hi, I'm Sydney! üëãüèª

I'm a first-year student at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://wpi.edu) majoring in Computer Science, with a particular interest in the intersection between computer science and biology.

Alongside this, I have a fascination with all things programming languages and even wrote [a simple compiler](https://github.com/cecelot/kyanite) ([high-level retrospective](https://sydneyn.dev/p/writing-a-compiler)) to learn more about how they work. 

I've spent most of my remaining time in the web development space, with my two main projects being
- my [personal site & blog](https://github.com/cecelot/forest) ([check it out](https://sydneyn.dev)); and
- [Olly](https://github.com/cecelot/olly), a game client & server for [Othello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi#Othello).

I'm currently interested in learning functional languages like [Haskell](https://haskell.org).
