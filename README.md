### Hi, I'm Sydney! 👋🏻

Explore my [/about](https://sydneyn.dev/about) page to learn all about me and my interests!

If you're interested in my current & prior work and some backstory, I'd love to introduce you to my [/projects](https://sydneyn.dev/projects) page, or dive into my pinned repositories below.

I publish my writing online [here](https://sydneyn.dev), and I also maintain an [/archive](https://sydneyn.dev/archive) for everything I post.

I'm currently interested in learning functional languages like [Haskell](https://haskell.org).
